# Wordle Heuristic Solver

This repository implements a rule-based (heuristic) Wordle solver that guesses words intelligently using letter frequency and position-based scoring â€” no machine learning required.

## Features

- Starts with the MIT-recommended word "salet"
- Avoids repeated letters in early guesses when possible
- Filters remaining words based on feedback from all previous guesses
- Interactive mode with Wordle-style feedback (ðŸŸ©, ðŸŸ¨, â¬›)
- Simulation mode to compute average guesses and solve rate over all answers
- Uses only built-in Python libraries (no external dependencies)


---


## How to Run

### Step 1: Ensure you have Python 3 installed

### Step 2: Run the script
python heuristics_wordle_solver.py

### Step 3: Select a mode when prompted
1. Guess a random word and show feedback after each guess
2. Run full simulation (average guesses over all solutions)

Sample Output (Simulation)

Average number of guesses: 3.79
Percentage of words solved in 6 or fewer guesses: 99.09%

Future Improvements
	â€¢	Add guess distribution visualizations
	â€¢	Implement hard mode constraints
	â€¢	Expand ai_wordle_solver.ipynb with reinforcement learning
